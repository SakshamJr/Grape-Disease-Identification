## Grape Disease Detection System
This repository contains the code for a deep learning-based grape disease detection system. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify various grape diseases from images, achieving 98% accuracy. It also includes a web interface for users to upload images and get disease predictions and remedies.

### Features
 - High Accuracy: 98% accuracy in detecting grape diseases.
 - Web Interface: Upload images and get instant predictions and remedies.

### What I Learned:
 - CNNs for robust image classification
 - Data Augmentation
 - Pooling layers to reduce dimensions
 - Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
 - Hyperparameter Tuning for improving efficiency
 - Tensorflow input pipelines for efficient data handling
 - Basic insights on FastAPI

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to implement my understanding of deep learning concepts while exploring new technologies(like FastAPI for deployment, tf input pipelines, etc).

I am excited to continue learning and contributing to innovations that benefit our society. #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #DataScience
